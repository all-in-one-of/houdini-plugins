# Houdini Plugins

## Overview
This is a place to put all of the Houdini plugins, scripts, etcâ€¦ That I work on, so they don't get lost, and in the off chance they prove useful, others can find them.

### POPs
* **Repulse POP** - Creates a small field that helps to keep particles separated, based on their radius.
* **Bullet POP** - Uses the Bullet library to allow for RBD collisions. Only supports spheres right now, and is missing robust rotation support.

### SOPs
* **Pack SOP** - Uses the Bullet Library to pack a series of objects together.

### Pipeline
* **floo** - A semi-hacky way to manage jobs on a few computers.
